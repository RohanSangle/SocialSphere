## Tech Stack

**Client:** React.js, Redux, Vanilla CSS

**Server:** Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT


## Lessons Learned

Took a lot of time learnig Redux and custom Auth, but now as i have learned it it feels exciting to have completed the MERN stack and to be able to build full scale MVP's.
I guess this is the last one for my Web dev journey, will now be going into Mobile dev and Freelancing <3
